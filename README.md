## Description
Market Analysis is a data science collaboration project of Aalto University bachelor students with a digital innovation and engineering company from Finland, Futurice. 
It is essential for Futurice as a consulting company to understand the market situation and emerging business topics of client companies. 


Therefore, our motivation for the project was to gain an understanding of the market/industries, and then transform it into essential knowledge about all of those companies so that the project could benefit Futurice in their research work.


As the result, from 400 business and technology articles from 5 conferences the team gained impactful knowledge about current situation in the market. The knowledge, in turn, is visualized in various graphs, plots, and interactive barcharts.


### To fully examine the project, please visit the [Final report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlW0jN_-YeFXaHFqtsxEePpSCyPvxBmePFNQE8Lc78A/edit?usp=sharing), that includes overall process, code highlights and results visualizations. Due to the time boundaries, the Heroku version of the website is incomplete, however, the final website code is available in the [Local App](https://github.com/angelineov/Data-science-project/blob/master/Website/final_local_app_with_all_plots.py), the missing results and visualization are also available below and in the Final report.
