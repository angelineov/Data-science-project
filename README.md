# Data-science-project
Market Analysis is a data science collaboration project of Aalto University bachelor students with a digital innovation and engineering company from Finland, Futurice. 
It is essential for Futurice as a consulting company to understand the market situation and emerging business topics of client companies. Therefore, our motivation for the project was to gain an understanding of the market/industries, and then transform it into essential knowledge about all of those companies so that the project could benefit Futurice in their research work.
