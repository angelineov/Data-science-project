You can AI like an Expert,"The talk will discuss Wolfram’s progress towards an entirely automated workflow for machine learning that makes it possible for anyone who can code to make use of AI methods.

The talk will assume no knowledge of machine learning and will introduce key concepts before showing how to use the Wolfram Language to create advanced predictors from scratch, in seconds. Use will be made of the Wolfram Language functions Predict and Classify which automate the process of data encoding, feature extraction, method selection, training, end decoding. The net result is a single function that produces a ready-to-use classifier or predictor, directly from raw data.","Wolfram Research Europe Ltd., UK"
Deep Learning for Lazy People... Neural Architecture Search with Automated Machine Learning,"Deep Learning models are great, but choosing the right architecture is not easy. Many times, the easiest way of getting the best architecture is just by trying.
It would be nice to have a clairvoyant that is able to tell us the best architecture, right? We cannot have a clairvoyant but we have tools, like Automated Machine Learning, that are able to find the best architectures just with a few lines of code.","RavenPack, Spain
