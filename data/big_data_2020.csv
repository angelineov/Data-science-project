Trust and Quality in the Era of Software 2.0,"There is a widespread excitement about the potential of Machine Learning (ML) models, but with market pressures, haste to ship and deliver them; those models fail to deliver what they promise or even worse they can have a negative impact for businesses and individuals. It is our thesis that just as we define quality properties for governing a typical software system from the way it is implemented (e.g. maintainability) to the way it behaves (e.g. functional suitability), we need to do a similar thing for ML models. That is why apart from Accuracy, the so-called F.A.T. properties, (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency) should be essential quality properties for a ML model (or AI system) contributing towards its adoption and trusted governance. In his talk Yiannis Kanellopoulos will present an approach on how an ML model can be evaluated in terms of its Fairness, Accountability and Transparency. Using examples of case studies (from industrial and publicly available datasets) Yiannis will share insights and the benefits one can get by making a ML model accountable, transparent and trying to mitigate its biases.","Greece, Code4Thought"

"Streaming Processing – an Overview of the Concepts, Architecture and Technology of Doing Data Science on Real-Time Data","Streaming Processing (or Fast Data processing) is becoming an increasingly popular subject in financial services, marketing, the internet of things, and healthcare. A typical stream processing solution follows a ‘pipes and filters’ pattern that consists of three main steps: detecting patterns on raw event data (Complex Event Processing), evaluating the outcomes with the aid of business rules and machine learning algorithms, and deciding on the next action. At the core of this architecture is the execution of predictive models that operate on enormous amounts of never-ending data streams. In this talk, Bas will present an architecture for streaming analytics solutions that covers many use cases that follow this pattern: actionable insights, fraud detection, log parsing, traffic analysis, factory data, the IoT, and others. He’ll go through a few architecture challenges that will arise when dealing with streaming data, such as latency issues, event time vs server time, and exactly-once processing. Finally, he’ll discuss some technology options as possible implementations of the architecture.","The Netherlands, Aizonic"

From Internet Access Devices Usage to Behavioural Model,"The way of using mouse, keyboard, tablet or phone can be a great source of the information about user behaviour. Data can be gathered from a spectrum of sensors built into these devices. Then this data can be transferred into features which characterize user, like manner of typing, speed of cursor or mouse movement curve. This presentation will focus on how to use those features to build behavioural model which will be unique and adjusted to each of thousends of customers. This problem has some important additional aspects. For one user several different models can be built, therefore some aggregation methods has to be delivered. Some of data has to be anonymized. Continuous authentication is excepted by business. These factors define important limitations for models productionization. They will also be discussed.","Poland, Digital Fingerprints"
